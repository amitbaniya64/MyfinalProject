# Back-End-ClassProject-C#.Net

 This is a class project named Koshi,which I have posted in my repo.I created this app in order to fulfill the basic requirements for CodeLouisville's C# course for graded syatem. 
 This is an online shopping web app where you can go and buy products. This project has admin area too and it is remain default for now for the admin's regisistration.
 Customers can select their desire products and can add to the cart or may delete them, further they can be checkout and place them in order. 
 To make more responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes or screen resolutions for the project I have used bootstrap and some custom css. It has been implemented some jQuery functionality to create forms and validation for them. It has been added some other interactivity functionalities to perform some actions. I have used C# language, SQL database, and the ASP.Net MVC web app framework for the project and it has implemented CRUD functions as well. In future,it may have very helpfull resources to the beginners for their simple project
 start as I have made some helpfull comments in the major sections of my code, so viewers can understand what the major parts of my code do.
